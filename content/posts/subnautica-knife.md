# Overview

This was my first attempt at selling a product as well as my first project into blade smithing and low volume mass production.
Subnautica is one of my favorite games for its unique story and its great artworks. Given that I had access to a very capable machine shop, I wanted to create the most accurate replica of the iconic survival knife. To take it one step further, I want to sell many of these knives to fund the development and maybe provide some extra funding for future projects.

# CAD

![CAD](image(3).png)

To speed up development and because I lacked sufficient freeform CAD skills to model the whole knife, I purchased a model of the knife. After aquiring the files, I modified the file by deleting the blade portion, modeling my own blade that's compatible with laser cutting, and created a cavity in the remaining handle to accept the blade. The general design is that the laser cut blade with metal tubes inserted in the handle portion would have two 3D printed handle halves sandwich either side. Once everything was in place, the handle would be epoxyed together and acetone fused to create the finished product. The blade would consist entirely of hardened, sharpend metal while the handle is a mix of abs, tpu, and resin parts. Following CAD finalization, a few prototype blades where cut.

## Test Articles

Blades started out as a sheet of 0.18" or 0.12" AEB-L stainless steel. This sheet would be inserted into a fiber laser that cut 15 blade outlines into the sheet. Then, the blades would be removed and have their edges deburred on a belt sander. 

# Blade Fabrication

## Laser Cutting

![Blade 2](20240322_140522.jpg)

## Electro Etching

The knife's blade has a very iconic triangular shaped indent on both sides. Given the depth of this indent, the only option available to me was etching. After experimentation between electro and chemical etching, electro proved more consistent. The blades are first covered in specially cut vinyl that wraps around the entire blade, exposing only the triangle to be etched, Then the entire blade is inserted into a salt water bath where over the course of roughly one hour, the
exposed metal portion would be eaten away thus creating the desired indent. The blades are then removed, the vinyl stripped, and immediately dried to prevent rusting.

## Edge Grinding

The initial edge of the blade is ground using a blade jig and belt sander. Before grinding both sides are marked with a line that tells how far to grind each edge. The knife is a double bevel knife so the jig is angled so when both edges are ground, they meet at exactly the center of the knife's thickness. Each blade must be ground four times, one for each edge. After final checks are complete, the blades are ready to be hardened.

## Vacuum Furnace Heat Treating

Initially, an in house furnace was selected but after significant oxidation appeared on the surface, a professional hardener was selected to harden the blades in their vacuum furnace.

## Chemical Laser Etching

Following hardening, the blades are polished using progressively increasing grits of sand paper and ending in a polishing wheel. The "Alterra Arms Incorporated" logo is also lasered on using omtech laser spray hit with a CO2 laser.

## Sharpening

Once the logo is bonded, the blades are immediately shipped to be sharpened. I talked with several sharpeners before deciding to go with a friend I met online who quoted me a good price. This process puts the final mirror finish on the edge and allow the blades to achieve paper cutting performance.

The blades are now ready for final assembly

# Handle Fabrication

## 3D Printing

The handle consistes of many  3D printed parts, mostly because there are multiple colors involved and I did not have a colors switching 3D printer. Instead, two printers ran simultaneously with one printing white parts, and the other printing black parts. Each part is designed to slot into specially made grooves or nubs in another part and fused together with acetone. Two halves would be almost entirely assembled before being brought onto a finished blade for final assembly.

On a different printer is the tpu grip. This material was a lot harder to work with and had numerous stringing issues. When completed, this part would also be joined onto a finished blade and secured with epoxy

## Resin Casting

One of the most iconic parts of the blade is its glowing elements, specifically around its hole and button perimeter. To achieve this without ultra small electronics, the parts must be phosphorescent. To create this part, a positive mold is SLA printed. Using this mold, a silicone negative is created. Finally, resin mixed with phosporescent powder is poured into the negative and once dry, the glowing blue part is ready for installation.

# Packaging

I wanted to give the blades premium feel and thus, picked black cardboard boxes. To cushion the blade durinn transport, the boxe's interior held three layers of foam, two rectangular layers the same size as the box floor and one laser cut layer with the outline of the knife. Ideally, this will protect the knife as well as serve as a stylish storage box.

# Cost/Stats

Of the 30 blades produced, 22 survived the manufacturing process and 15 were sold. The total costs are as follows:

## Material Costs
- metal: $250
- resin: $40
- epoxy: $25
- ABS filament: $14
- steel tubes: $12
- acetone: $25
- laser engraving spray: $35

## Tools Costs
- edge grinding jig: $120
- syringe: $25
- buffing wheels: $35
- buffing wheel grit: $25

## Service Costs
- vacumm furnace fee: $305
- sharpening fee: $220

This comes to a grand total of $1,131 sunk into the project.

## Revenue

15 x $212 = $3180

## Profit(?)

The math SHOULD be 3180 - 1131 = 2049 in profits.

This is where I should say that it was a grand success but unfortunately I must also give the hard truth that I made a slight miscalculation. Given my supposed steep markup, I promised free shipping... and then receieved over half my orders over seas. I greatly appreciated the worldwide support but when all my orders are coming from the Neatherlands and Sweden, the logistics got quite a bit more complicated. At a price betwee $70-$120 per blade in shipping, I essentally erased all my profits. Now the math looks like this: 3180 - 1131 - 1500 = $549. Couple that with other small fees and tax. I just about broke even.

# Conclusion

{{<youtube BYlOVSRbSb0>}}

This project is probably the most unrelated to my field of expertiese but was a very fun experience that gave me insight into the logistics of manufacturing and managing various tasks to ensure the product is finished on time. The entire project went from idea to finished sales in less than two months so the pacing was very fast. As of now, I've made barely enough to cover development cost so while the profits are not as high as I hoped, it's still encouraging.
