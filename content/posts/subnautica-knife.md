This is 1:1 replica of the iconic survival knife from the game subnautica.

# Overview

This was my first attempt at selling a product as well as my first project into blade smithing and low volume mass production.
Subnautica is one of my favorite games for its unique story and its great artworks. Given that I had access to a very capable machine shop, I wanted to create the most accurate replica of the iconic survival knife. To take it one step further, I want to sell many of these knives to fund the development and maybe provide some extra funding for future projects.

# CAD

To speed up development and because I lacked sufficient freeform CAD skills to model the whole knife, I purchased a model of the knife. After aquiring the files, I modified the file by deleting the blade portion, modeling my own blade that's compatible with laser cutting, and created a cavity in the remaining handle to accept the blade. The general design is that the laser cut blade with metal tubes inserted in the handle portion would have two 3D printed handle halves sandwich either
side. Once everything was in place, the handle would be epoxyed together and acetone fused to create the finished product. The blade would consist entirely of hardened, sharpend metal while the handle is a mix of abs, tpu, and resin parts. Following CAD finalization, a few prototype blades where cut.

# Blade Fabrication

![Blade](20240304_211952.jpg)

Blades started out as a sheet of 0.18" or 0.12" AEB-L stainless steel. This sheet would be inserted into a fiber laser that cut 15 blade outlines into the sheet. Then, the blades would be removed and have their edges deburred on a belt sander.

The knife's blade has a very iconic triangular shaped indent on both sides. Given the depth of this indent, the only option available to me was etching. After experimentation between electro and chemical etching, electro proved more consistent. The blades are first covered in specially cut vinyl that wraps around the entire blade, exposing only the triangle to be etched, Then the entire blade is inserted into a salt water bath where over the course of roughly one hour, the
exposed metal portion would be eaten away thus creating the desired indent. The blades are then removed, the vinyl stripped, and immediately dried to prevent rusting.

The initial edge of the blade is ground using a blade jig and belt sander. Before grinding both sides are marked with a line that tells how far to grind each edge. The knife is a double bevel knife so the jig is angled so when both edges are ground, they meet at exactly the center of the knife's thickness. Each blade must be ground four times, one for each edge. After final checks are complete, the blades are ready to be hardened.

Initially, an in house furnace was selected but after significant oxidation appeared on the surface, a professional hardener was selected to harden the blades in their vacuum furnace.

Following hardening, the blades are polished using progressively increasing grits of sand paper and ending in a polishing wheel. The "Alterra Arms Incorporated" logo is also lasered on using omtech laser spray hit with a CO2 laser.

Once the logo is bonded, the blades are immediately shipped to be sharpened. This put the final mirror finish on the edge and allow the blades to achieve paper cutting performance.

The final step is to press the two 10mm steel tubes into their holes in the blade's handle portion. These tubes would retain the blade once the handle is intalled.

The blades are now ready for final assembly

# 3D Printing

The handle consistes of many  3D printed parts, mostly because there are multiple colors involved and I did not have a colors switching 3D printer. Instead, two printers ran simultaneously with one printing white parts, and the other printing black parts. Each part is designed to slot into specially made grooves or nubs in another part and fused together with acetone. Two halves would be almost entirely assembled before being brought onto a finished blade for final assembly.

On a different printer is the tpu grip. This material was a lot harder to work with and had numerous stringing issues. When completed, this part would also be joined onto a finished blade and secured with epoxy

# Resin Casting

One of the most iconic parts of the blade is its glowing elements, specifically around its hole and button perimeter. To achieve this without ultra small electronics, the parts must be phosphorescent. To create this part, a positive mold is SLA printed. Using this mold, a silicone negative is created. Finally, resin mixed with phosporescent powder is poured into the negative and once dry, the glowing blue part is ready for installation.

# Packaging

I wanted to give the blades premium feel and thus, picked black cardboard boxes. To cushion the blade durinn transport, the boxe's interior held three layers of foam, two rectangular layers the same size as the box floor and one laser cut layer with the outline of the knife. Ideally, this will protect the knife as well as serve as a stylish storage box.

# Conclusion
This project is probably the most unrelated to my field of expertiese but was a very fun experience that gave me insight into the logistics of manufacturing and managing various tasks to ensure the product is finished on time. As of now, I've made barely enough to cover development cost so while the profits are not as high as I hoped, it's still encouraging.
