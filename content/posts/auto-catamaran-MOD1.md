A revised version of the Oceangoing Catamaran USV project.

# Overview
Following the construction and testing of the first Oceangoing Catamaran USV project, it was decided that a larger platform was needed to handle th rough conditions of the ocean. A major consideration was waterproofing the entire hull and streamline it for cutting through waves.

# Hull Changes
One of the largest changes was the switch from a traditional bow to an axe bow. While this USV is significantly larger than an RC boat, it is still very small even compared to the smallest manned craft. Its size means the hull will be constantly pitching and rolling with the waves, something that will be common in its intended operation area. An axe bow is a type of bow designed to cut through waves instead of riding over them. This decreases the pitching motion when running into
waves but means the craft will be constantly immersed in water.

# Waterproofing
As discussed in the previous section, the hull will be constantly immersed in water, thus requiring a major upgrade to waterproofing. The new lid design is dome shaped compared to the flat shape found in the previous hull. This way, water slides off the surface instead of pooling. The lid hull interface also features a 45 degree slope lined with gasket tape. When screwed down, the lid compresses this gasket layer creating a waterproof seal. Power and data cables travelling between the hulls
are routed along the 8040 extrusion bridgedeck via vestibule compartments that have hot swappable lids to suit different mission profiles.

# Swappable Motors
Given the complex process of servicing jet drives embedded in the hull, this new version moves the jet assembly into a separate compartment that can be quickly removed for servicing. This flexibility also allows for the fast swapping of damaged jets or an entirely different drive system.

# Production
Currently, one hull is under production for waterproof evaluation. The final product should be a hull of this size but for testing software and electrical systems, a smaller hull will be used. This hull takes all the lessons and data gathered from the construction of prototype 1 and implements them in a cleaner platform.
