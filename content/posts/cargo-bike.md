My reliable and extremely capable transport for the last few years. With over 400 lbs of carrying capacity and excellent off road handling, it's a go-anywhere machine.

# Overview

![cargo 1](20220609_091256.jpg)

I initially conceieved this idea as a compromise between my like for biking and my need to transport more than average amounts of equipment. The cargo bike is a perfect vehicle as it's cheaper to operate than a car and allows me to bring my cargo directly into buildings instead of walking the last stretch on foot. Bikes are also great excercise and despite it's size the frame is well suited for off road trails. Overall, a greate machine.

# Hardware Mods

![bare frame](20231125_140825.jpg)

The bike is a Mongoose Envoy midtail cargo bike which is an affordable, high weight capacity, aluminum frame bike. Stock, it's already a capable machine, although with some dealbreaking shortcomings (that can be fixed). The first is brakes. The stock brakes are cable disk brakes which isn't strong enough when fully loaded. I replaced the brakes with Magura MT5 4 pot hydraulic brakes and the rotors with massive 203mm ones. This setup is designed for downhill mountain bikes but also
suitable for stopping a 400+ lbs bike. In order to cope with the extra weight and minimize tire punctures, the stock tires were replaced with Schwalbe Pick-ups and gel filled tubes. As the frame is rigid (no shock absorbers) I replaced the stock seatpost with Suntour NCX suspension seatpost.

# Cargo Bags/Rack

![cargo bag](20230127_112547.jpg)

To increase cargo capacity, I largely followed [Tales On Two Wheels'](https://talesontwowheels.com/2019/09/25/the-mongoose-envoy-project/) tutorial to construct larger cargo bags and stap systems. The stock bags were replaced with 76L parachute bags with grommets hammered into them. These grommets would secure the bag to the bike via hooks. Additional velcro straps provided more stability once the loaded bike starts moving. The front rack is a Axiom rear rack secured to the
front axle using a rear skewer.

# Electrification

![motor](20230126_200914.jpg)

I added a motor mainly so that I could bike faster with cargo. The motor effectively cancels out the extra weight and if I need to, I can also throttle like a moped. The kit I selected was the Bafang BBSDH for its proven reliability and ease of installation. Currently I have two 52v batteries, one 17.5ah and the other 25ah. With light cargo and generous pedaling, the batteries combine can propel the bike for over 80 miles.

I also installed a 360W 60v to 12v 30A converter and a plug panel so I can directly charge my usb devices or power wall electronics via an inverter.

# Trailer

{{< figure src="20230526_191941.jpg" title="bike with trailer">}}

The addition of the trailer allows for the transport of unusually large pieces of cargo. It was also added to accomodate solar panels for the solar ebike project (see other page). The trailer is a single wheel Burley coho xc. Its one wheel design allows it to lean with the bike which is great of offroad terrain. The entire rig is less than 4 feet wide.

Having only one wheel, the trailer needs two points on the bike to stay level. Normally this would be conducted via a custom skewer that goes through the rear axle. However, the Envoy's rear runner boards prevents this mounting solution not to mention it prevents me from using the parachute bags while the trailer is attached. The solution is a custom welded adapter that acts as a third axle mount point.

To accomodate solar panels and long, flat panels, two laser cut and welded supports structures were fabbed and screwed into the trailer's existing hardpoints.

# Dashcams

![rear dash](20240209_134238.jpg)

Because of the hazardous road conditions and wanting to record fun videos, I installed dashcams to the front and rear of the bike. These dashcams were originally meant for motorcycles but because they run off 12v, I can directly connect it to the 12v converter. The screen allows for android auto which is nice since I can now use gps without the hassle of a phone mount.

# Frame Bags (in progress)

![bag stencil](20240705_184610.jpg)

I'm in the early stages of planning custom frame bags to store additional gear and weatherproof certain electronic components. I first made rough stencils of the bag shapes using cardboard. After I finalized the measurements, I'll cut the material and sew it together. Finally, I'll mount the bags and rewire the electronics.

# Conclusion
Probably the most useful project I've ever made. this bike has carried me over 3k miles over the last 3 years. I use it almost every day and everything has worked without a problem. Looking forward to what other features I can add to this.
