## Introduction

Web development is a vast and exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're starting your journey as a developer or looking to expand your knowledge, understanding the fundamentals is crucial.

## HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every website. It provides the structure and content that browsers interpret and display.

### Elements and Tags

### Selectors

CSS selectors determine which elements your styles will apply to. Understanding them is key to effective styling.

### Box Model

The box model is a fundamental concept that defines how elements are sized and spaced on your page.

## JavaScript Essentials

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

### Variables and Data Types

Learn about different ways to store and manipulate data in JavaScript.
