# Overview

This was a project I made in high school for my AP biology class final project. The idea is a smart terrarium constructed out ot recycled parts. The frame is an old PC tower and the old ATX power supply holder was converted into an electronics housing for powering the terrarium's various functions. At the bottom of the frame, covered in dirt, is a water reservoir which is pumped up the concrete tower and flows back down via a waterfall. The tower also contains an ultrasonic mist maker for asthetics. There is also a pc fan for ventilation and bright led lights. The project is more asthetics than actually functional but it was the very first arduino project I've made. It's also the first project where I sustained a relatively major injury (just stitches) but definitely not the last.

# Video

This is the only surviving media of this contraption. I filmed it during lunch period one day before the exhibit ended. After taking it home, the project was gutted for parts (I didn't have a lot back then). I do wish to make a newer version because the idea of plants in a recycled PC case is very asthetically pleasing.
