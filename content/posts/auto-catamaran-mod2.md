# Overview
A production model of the ongoing catamaran USV project. This hull emphasizes portability and waterproofness, implementing many features from previous design along with several new design elements. This craft is designed to be the most reliable and versatile craft, being easily transportable, having large payload capacity, long mission endurance.

# Design Considerations
To be more transportable, the length has been reduced to 5 ft and the width reduced to 4 ft allowing it to fit in elevators. To simplify construction and reduce weight, the number of compartments has been reduced to 3 independently watertight compartments. In previous variants, there was a risk for water to enter through the jet drive assembly. To mitigate this, the entire drive assembly is contained in a separate compartment with no drive linkages between it and the main compartments. For
more efficiency and to conform to existing ardupilot frames, The jet drive was replaced with reversible ducted propellers on vectored mounts. These rear props can rotate in a 180 degree arc and when combine with the bow thrusters, achieves omnidirectional motion without the need for stern thrusters.
