As one of the first modeling tools I learned, CAD is an integral step in my design process.

# Overview

Over the years, I've worked with primarily Fusion360 and a bit of solidworks. These pieces of software are essential to modeling parts for 3D printing, laser cutting, CNCing, or just planning the completed layout. There's not too much to talk about so I'll just show a few of the models I've made. These are some miscellaneous pieces as most of my complex models are shown in their dedicated pages.

# Conclusion

Great tools. It's great for planning projects and getting a sneak peak at what the project will look like before its made.
