A powerful but portable ebike for long distance touring and commuting.

# Overview
This is my folding eike designed to be a powerful touring setup. The entire rig without batteries weighs in at 47 lbs which makes it air transportable in a standard check in suitcase. I've made various mods to make it more reliable and suited for it's role

# Idea
The overall travel setup goes something like this: I put the bike in a suitcase and put all my touring gear in a carryon backpack. Upon landing, I take the bike out of the suitcase and put my backpack in. Then, I bolt 10 inch bike tires to the suitcase and tow it behind the bike. This is the exact setup of Bike Friday's suitcase trailer which appears to be discontinued now. For regular use, the folding feature is great for tight spaces in stores or on public transit. So far, the system is
working great
