### Some info about myself.

My name is Robin Wang and I am a recent graduate from University of California, San Diego with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. Aside from the regular university classes, I am an avid robotics enthusiast and have built several projects related to the topic. I focus primarily on hardware and electrical system integration, especially on vehicle platforms. Feel free to check out some of my past works and reach out to me with any questions.
