This project aims to bring an in-game piece of equipment to the real world. The primary focus of this project will be:\nmaking complex, well organized, CAD assemblies robust sensor network with interlocks to allow for smooth, controlled motions stm32 based control system for triggering motion sequences, special effects, etc Inspiration - ANIME WARNING (optional read - skip to “In Game Reference” if not interested) Story Background Combat in a contaminated zone\rAlright I ain’t gonna sugarcoat this. The game this is from is a little known gacha called GFL. Despite the anime asthetics, the story is quite dark. If you’re not interested in the context and just want to know about the engineering process, skip to the next section: “In Game Reference”. You’ve been warned.\nThe story takes place in an future (206x) post apocalypes alternate timeline of Earth which has been ravaged by three world wars followed by a plague of alien origin. In the aftermath of all this, the remaining governments and elites of society holed themselves into the few uncontaminated regions, isolating themselves behind massive quarantine walls. The hazards of the contaminated region saw the widespread use of Private Military Contractors (PMCs) which extensively used “Tactical Dolls” (T-Dolls), essentially sentient androids who are better suited for work in irradiated areas. They are used for jobs ranging from construction to armed security and are often directed by a human operator(you) situated in forward bases. There’s way too much to get into but the story is long, involving rouge AIs, government splinter factions, cultists, and a grand conspiracy. Real dark stuff.\nDespite the bleak setting, the story focuses quite heavily on individual struggle as well as the desire to defy the fate the world has laided out for the main cast. I especially like the artwork of the setting which often portrayed with few colors and abstract brush strokes. As you can probably tell, I’m in it for the story (and the robots).\nA severely contaminated zone\rCivil unrest in Berlin\rShore guns of the Paldiski submarine base located in Estonia\rBerlin quarantine wall between green and yellow zones\rM4A1 - Character in question M4A1 MOD 3 default art. The cannon in question is folded and slung behind her\rThe lore is that PMCs aren’t allowed to use weapons newer than those used during WW3, aka thing up to and including modern weapon. Due to technological imitations, T-Dolls are only capable of proficiently operating one weapons platform, thus swapping is not possible. As a result, the PMC the player is assigned to names their T-Dolls the same as the firearm they use. Thus, the T-Doll who uses the M4A1 carbine is named “M4A1”. At some point, in the story, a mentor transfers the particle cannon to her which was a memento from an earlier “sister” unit who is now missing.\nIn Game Reference research images\rThe first step was finding reference material as well as researching the lore to determine the capabilities and functions of the cannon. This resulted in me digging up all sorts of in game images and extracting game files to see what needs to get implemented. The game is notorious for artistic inconsistencies so I was forced to compromise on certain aspects to maintain the aesthetic integrity while still making it feasible to manufacture.\nHardware Design Shell shell exterior\rThe first step is to create an accurate 1:1 exterior copy of the cannon. First, accurate exterior dimensions needed to be established. This was done by referencing the in game height description of the character, then pixel counting to determine the length of the box. From there, width and depth can be extrapolated. This was used to create a rectangle matching the exterior dimensions of the box. From there, flat images of each side of the box were applied to the surface of the box so surface details could be drawn and carved. Finally, the box was hollowed out in preparation for the interior.\nfolded side view\rfolded side/top view\rfolded front view\rdeployed side view\rFrame main body extrusion frame\rIhe entire cannon is over 4 ft long and must be rigid in order for the mechanisms to function properly. I selected 2020 aluminum extrusion for it’s ease of access and wide parts compatibility. The main body uses 2020 extrusion segments along with 90 degree brackets. For cases where brackets would interfere with other mechanisms, low profile laser cut brackets would be used instead.\nmain body extrusion frame side\rmain body extrusion frame back\rBarrel barrel\rThe barrel is the largest moving mechanism on the cannon. It’s a two stage actuation requiring the lower portion to slide forward then drop down. I implemented the slide portion with a linear actuator attached to a carriage riding on a length of extrusion on the lower barrel. The drop down is handled by another linear actuator. A parallelogram linkage ensures the lower and upper portions are always parallel. The main difficulty was the tight space constraints. I had to reserve space for the large exhaust cone and gas tube’s bend radius without compromising the linkage’s strength.\nbarrel folded\rbarrel slide forward\rbarrel drop down\rgas tube stow position\rside view slice\rbarrel front crosssection with cavities for fasteners\rTrigger folding grip and slide assembly\rProbably one of the most annoying mechanisms would be the grip assembly. The main issue is that not only does the grip have to extend, the entire block the grip is mounted must also be capable of sliding. The lore reason escapes me and while it looks pretty cool, implementing this was a struggle.\nFolding Grip trigger linkage\rThe grip contains two folding components: the grip, and a recoil brace behind it. I reference many real world rocket/missile launcher designs to get an acceptablly ergonomic shape. The two components are actuated via a single linear actuator connected to a load transfer plate. This plate synchronizes the grip and recoil spade’s movement such that over the length of the actuator’s travel, the grip rotates 90 degrees while simultaneously rotating the recoil spade 35 degrees.\ntrigger folded\rtrigger deployed\rMoving Trigger Block trigger block assembly\rHowever, as the entire trigger block must slide back and fourth, I had to contain the rotation mechanism such that it could be mounted to linear rails. As the entire weight of the cannon would be resting on this moving trigger block, two linear rails were used. It is also why every actuatior is doubled up and rated for 120Nm of torque.\ntrigger block back stop\rtrigger block front stop folding assembly/double linear actuators Light Covers light covers\rThe two remaining mechanisms are responsible for raising several panels on the cannon revealing glowing green lights. At this point, space is a premium as gas and electrical lines still need to be routed. Thus, I had to get more creative with how to save space.\nTriangle triangle linkage\rThe first and simpler of the two is a triangle located towards the front of the box. This only needs to raise vertically by 15mm. The best place to mount the actuator would be between the upper extrusion frames. I designed a simple 90 degree linear joint to translate horizontal linear motion to vertical linear motion.\ntriangle lowered\rtriangle raised\rTriple Covers triple cover assembly\rThe second mechanism involves raising three panels simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical direction. In order to reduce space and construction cost, I planned to use only one actuator for the entire motion. In order to achieve two directions of movement, I attached the vertical motion assembly onto a horizontally traversing carriage. Then I designed a slot with a 90 degree bend that the vertical assembly slots into. As the linear actuator pulls the carriage along, the vertical assembly moves with it until it reaches the bend where it then begins raising.\ncovers lowered\rcovers raised\rThe entire assembly is narrow enoug to fit between the extrusion rails\rGas System gas system\rIn order to create a realistic firing effect, it was planned for a propane plasma cannon to be installed inside the frame. When the trigger is pulled, a solenoid opens which allows gas to vent through a tube where it collects inside the emitter located in the deployed barrel. After a delay, this gas is electroncially sparked causing a flame to travel from the gas cylinder down the length of the tube. Once this flame reaches the emitter, the increased gas volume combine with the open air creates a large bang as well as a fireball. In order to shield plastic components from heat, all surfaces in the path of the fireball are covered in either sheet metal or heat reflective tape. The gas cylinder is easily replaceable via a quick eject system.\ngas pipeline\rgas routing\rgas cylinder mounted\rgas cylinder ejected\rcannon firing animation\rElectrical Design - CURRENTLY WORKING ON Sensors In order for all actuators and special effects to operate correctly and safely, numerous sensors are mounted throughout the frame to monitor the position of each actuator, temperature, voltage, current, etc.\nFor all linear actuators, each end of travel contains a permanent magnet endstop. when the joint approaches an endstop, a hall effect sensor located on the moving assembly will detect this endstop and raise the proper flag. As a last resort, there are also mechanical endstops but will result in the actuator stalling.\nThe most potentially dangerous system is the gas line. In order to prevent overheating as well as accidental gas release, the solenoid and electronic trigger both have physical disconnect switches. The solenoid in particular has a separate endstop switch that checks for potential jams in the open position. There are also temperature sensors running the length of the gas tube to monitor temperature. The gas system works with the actuator sensors to prevent activating the gas system when the barrel is not fully deployed. If any safety flags are tripped, the gas system shuts down and an error flag is sent to the central control system.\nControl Electronics One of the things I hoped to get out of this project was more STM32 pcb design experience.

For cases where brackets would interfere with other mechanisms, low profile laser cut brackets would be used instead.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=extrusionside.png><figcaption>main body extrusion frame side</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=extrusionback.png><figcaption>main body extrusion frame back</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=barrel>Barrel<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#barrel>#</a></h2><figure><img loading=lazy src=barrel.png><figcaption>barrel</figcaption></figure><p>The barrel is the largest moving mechanism on the cannon. It&rsquo;s a two stage actuation requiring the lower portion to slide forward then drop down. I implemented the slide portion with a linear actuator attached to a carriage riding on a length of extrusion on the lower barrel. The drop down is handled by another linear actuator. A parallelogram linkage ensures the lower and upper portions are always parallel. The main difficulty was the tight space constraints. I had to reserve space for the large exhaust cone and gas tube&rsquo;s bend radius without compromising the linkage&rsquo;s strength.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=barrelfolded.png><figcaption>barrel folded</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=barrelhalfextend.png><figcaption>barrel slide forward</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=barrelfullextend.png><figcaption>barrel drop down</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=barrelgastube.png><figcaption>gas tube stow position</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=barrelnocore.png><figcaption>side view slice</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=barrelfrontcross.png><figcaption>barrel front crosssection with cavities for fasteners</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=trigger>Trigger<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#trigger>#</a></h2><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggertitle.png><figcaption>folding grip and slide assembly</figcaption></figure><p>Probably one of the most annoying mechanisms would be the grip assembly. The main issue is that not only does the grip have to extend, the entire block the grip is mounted must also be capable of sliding. The lore reason escapes me and while it looks pretty cool, implementing this was a struggle.</p><h3 id=folding-grip>Folding Grip<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#folding-grip>#</a></h3><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggerlink.png><figcaption>trigger linkage</figcaption></figure><p>The grip contains two folding components: the grip, and a recoil brace behind it. I reference many real world rocket/missile launcher designs to get an acceptablly ergonomic shape. The two components are actuated via a single linear actuator connected to a load transfer plate. This plate synchronizes the grip and recoil spade&rsquo;s movement such that over the length of the actuator&rsquo;s travel, the grip rotates 90 degrees while simultaneously rotating the recoil spade 35 degrees.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggerfolded.png><figcaption>trigger folded</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggerdeployed.png><figcaption>trigger deployed</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=moving-trigger-block>Moving Trigger Block<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#moving-trigger-block>#</a></h3><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggerassembly.png><figcaption>trigger block assembly</figcaption></figure><p>However, as the entire trigger block must slide back and fourth, I had to contain the rotation mechanism such that it could be mounted to linear rails. As the entire weight of the cannon would be resting on this moving trigger block, two linear rails were used. It is also why every actuatior is doubled up and rated for 120Nm of torque.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggerblockback.png><figcaption>trigger block back stop</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggerblockfront.png><figcaption>trigger block front stop</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=triggerlinkage.png><figcaption>folding assembly/double linear actuators</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=light-covers>Light Covers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#light-covers>#</a></h2><figure><img loading=lazy src=covertitle.png><figcaption>light covers</figcaption></figure><p>The two remaining mechanisms are responsible for raising several panels on the cannon revealing glowing green lights. At this point, space is a premium as gas and electrical lines still need to be routed. Thus, I had to get more creative with how to save space.</p><h3 id=triangle>Triangle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#triangle>#</a></h3><figure><img loading=lazy src=trianglelinkage.png><figcaption>triangle linkage</figcaption></figure><p>The first and simpler of the two is a triangle located towards the front of the box. This only needs to raise vertically by 15mm. The best place to mount the actuator would be between the upper extrusion frames. I designed a simple 90 degree linear joint to translate horizontal linear motion to vertical linear motion.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=trianglelowered.png><figcaption>triangle lowered</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=triangleRaised.png><figcaption>triangle raised</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=triple-covers>Triple Covers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#triple-covers>#</a></h3><figure><img loading=lazy src=coversiderear.png><figcaption>triple cover assembly</figcaption></figure><p>The second mechanism involves raising three panels simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical direction. In order to reduce space and construction cost, I planned to use only one actuator for the entire motion. In order to achieve two directions of movement, I attached the vertical motion assembly onto a horizontally traversing carriage. Then I designed a slot with a 90 degree bend that the vertical assembly slots into. As the linear actuator pulls the carriage along, the vertical assembly moves with it until it reaches the bend where it then begins raising.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=coverlowered.png><figcaption>covers lowered</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=coverraised.png><figcaption>covers raised</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=coversidetop.png><figcaption>The entire assembly is narrow enoug to fit between the extrusion rails</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=gas-system>Gas System<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gas-system>#</a></h2><figure><img loading=lazy src=gastitle.png><figcaption>gas system</figcaption></figure><p>In order to create a realistic firing effect, it was planned for a propane plasma cannon to be installed inside the frame. When the trigger is pulled, a solenoid opens which allows gas to vent through a tube where it collects inside the emitter located in the deployed barrel. After a delay, this gas is electroncially sparked causing a flame to travel from the gas cylinder down the length of the tube. Once this flame reaches the emitter, the increased gas volume combine with the open air creates a large bang as well as a fireball. In order to shield plastic components from heat, all surfaces in the path of the fireball are covered in either sheet metal or heat reflective tape. The gas cylinder is easily replaceable via a quick eject system.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=gaspipeline.png><figcaption>gas pipeline</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=gasrouting.png><figcaption>gas routing</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=gascylinderfolded.png><figcaption>gas cylinder mounted</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=gascylindereject.png><figcaption>gas cylinder ejected</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading=lazy src=m4firing.png><figcaption>cannon firing animation</figcaption></figure></p><h1 id=electrical-design---currently-working-on>Electrical Design - CURRENTLY WORKING ON<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#electrical-design---currently-working-on>#</a></h1><h2 id=sensors>Sensors<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sensors>#</a></h2><p>In order for all actuators and special effects to operate correctly and safely, numerous sensors are mounted throughout the frame to monitor the position of each actuator, temperature, voltage, current, etc.</p><p>For all linear actuators, each end of travel contains a permanent magnet endstop. when the joint approaches an endstop, a hall effect sensor located on the moving assembly will detect this endstop and raise the proper flag. As a last resort, there are also mechanical endstops but will result in the actuator stalling.</p><p>The most potentially dangerous system is the gas line. In order to prevent overheating as well as accidental gas release, the solenoid and electronic trigger both have physical disconnect switches. The solenoid in particular has a separate endstop switch that checks for potential jams in the open position. There are also temperature sensors running the length of the gas tube to monitor temperature. The gas system works with the actuator sensors to prevent activating the gas system when the barrel is not fully deployed. If any safety flags are tripped, the gas system shuts down and an error flag is sent to the central control system.</p><h2 id=control-electronics>Control Electronics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#control-electronics>#</a></h2><p>One of the things I hoped to get out of this project was more STM32 pcb design experience.
