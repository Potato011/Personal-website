This hull emphasizes portability and waterproofness, implementing many features from previous design along with several new design elements. This craft is designed to be the most reliable and versatile craft, being easily transportable, having large payload capacity, long mission endurance.\nA draft of the paper can be found here: Exploring Low-Cost 3D Printable USVs for the purpose of Shallow Water Inspections\nThis article a recounting of the process in my own words along with some tangents.\nRole: As the project lead, I was responsible for the complete hardware design and fabrication, electrical system architecture, and autopilot implementation. I also collaborated with other team members to organize pool tests and ready the paper for publication.\nDesign Considerations In order to be easily manufacturable at low cost as well as effective during operation, requirements for the craft were split into two categories, “Manufacturing” and “Operational”\nOperational unobstructed view of water directly below equipment deck able to continue operation after hull breech 60 lbs cargo capacity capable of withstanding temporary full immersion capable autonomous “lawnmower” path missions GPS waypoint navigation accuracy within 50cm capable of omnidirectional movement transportable in standard 4x5 ft elevator 24hr mission endurance Manufacturing majority 3D printed components on standard 250x250mm bed minimize use of specialty parts/tools modular extrusion based deck equipment mounts standardized fastener/hardware usage parts optimized for intuitive construction Conceptual Design \u0026 Studies An extensive design study was conducted in order to determine the optimal approach to achieve all design goals. As design decisions take both operational and manufacturing into account, this section will not be split but instead be divided into the major decisions.\nHull Design side view with dome lid\rside view with flat acrylic lid\rbottom view\rA catamaran hull was selected as its bridgedeck construction allows for downward facing cameras to have an unobstructed view of the water. The twin hull design also creates more compartmentalization thus increasing survivability in the event of a hull breech. Additionally, two hulls allows for smaller individual hull components without sacrificing payload capacity. This is important for increasing manufacturability on the limited print bed volumes of commercial 3D printers. 4080 extrusion was selected to serve as the bridgedeck. This increases stiffness of the hull while also providing modular mounting points for equipment Size was limited to a length of five feet and width of four feet in order to fit in elevators.\nAcetone Welding/Assembly acetone welded joint between hull segments\racetone brushed skin\rIn order to reduce complexity, hull construction heavily relied on the use of acetone welding. Acetone welding is a technique where an ABS plastic part is brushed with acetone and pressed to another ABS part. The acetone temporarily dissolves the surface of the part causing it to fuse with the second parts. Once the acetone dries, the bond is nearly as strong as the rest of the part. This technique minimizes the need for specialized tools and hardware while only using hardware grade parts. Acetone welding is used to join major hull segments as well as acetone brushing over surfaces to fuse layer lines. To align hull segments as well as provide structural support, each hull contains a 20x20 aluminum extrusion beam running the length of the hull where the keel is usually located. For non weldable areas, metric hardware is used along with heat set inserts. To minimize galvanic corrosion, all metallic parts are stainless steel or similar metals with \u003c0.25V.\nSeakeeping cross-section view\rTo handle rough wave conditions, special care was taken to design the hull shape as well as waterproofing features. Given the craft’s small size, riding over waves would create an unneccesaily violent pitching motion. Thus, an axe bow was determined to be the optimal bow shape. These bows cut through waves rather than ride over them, thus creating a smoother ride. However, this means the craft will be temporarily fully immersed which requires extensive waterproofing on all hatches and covers. This waterproofing came in the form of a dome lid secured using a series of screws compressing a layer of gasket liner. A simplified control panel consisting of waterproof switches is located at the aft of each hull under a splash resistant cover. Primary communication would be done wirelessly to reduce the number of ports exposed.\nPropulsion Vectored stern thrusters\rvector shaft tube with rotary grease seal\rPrevious tests using jet powered boats revealed that while power dense, these systems lack the responsiveness required for accurate survey work. Their reverse buckets were incompatible with the Ardupilot firmware planned to autonomously navigate the craft. As a result, a traditional stern mounted ducted propeller was selected. However, to increase maneuverability, these thrusters would not only be reversible but also be capable of differential vectored thrust up to 50 degrees on each side. Furthermore, these stern thrusters would be aided by two bow thrusters granting the boat omnidirectional movement and rapid course adjustment in complex environments. To power this sytem, two large 48v Li-ion batteries located in each hull through a custom redundant power distribution system.\nNavigation Vectored stern thrusters\rArdupilot, specifically Ardurover, was selected as it is the most robust autopilot software available. This software was installed into a Matek H7 based flight controller located in the left hull. For precise maneuvering, an RTK GPS receiver was installed on the craft’s bridgedeck along with a telemetry radio system for receiving correction data. This radio system is also responsible for supplying the mission coordinates from the base station.\nElectrical Layout circuit diagram\rPDB prototype\rwaterproof cable gland ports\rTo improve survivability in the event of a hull breach, each hull is designed for independent operation should the other be compromised. Both hulls contain its own battery capable of supplying enough power to the entire craft should one battery fail. This power is routed between hulls through a custom power distribution board (PDB) that supports bidirectional power transfer and emergency cutoff should a leak be detected. The PDB also minimizes the amount of wiring required between hulls as only a few data cables need to be passed between the hull in addition to the main power cables. The autopilot is enclosed in a self contained enclosure in the left hull but should that fail, the right hull is capable of manual maneuvering via radio.\nGallery side view\rrear view\rlift hardpoints use pvc pipes. also shows 20x20 extrusion keel tube\rcomparing past USV models\rcomparing past USV top view\rConstruction The hull was constructed with a large emphasis on acetone welding. many components were optimized for welding which reduced the number of bulkheads and thus the total hull weight. hull components being laid out for welding\rcenter hull components being welded\rfinal assembly with electronics\rhull prepped for painting\rhull painted\rTesting Several tests were conducted to ensure the craft’s structural integrity as well as evaluate it’s general performance. These started with manual controls and progressed to autonomous tests. As of now, more tuning is required in order to dial in the PID of it’s differential vectored thrusters. Note, some tests occured before painting in order to evaluate if acetone alone was enough to waterproof the hull.\nfirst float test\rdriving\rpost painting\rdriving more\rautonomous driving data logs\rHere are some videos from various tests\nThis is from the first test of the boat. At the time, there was no vectoring. Turning was a combination of differential thrust of the stern thruster and the bow thrusters. This is from the second test. Vectoring is also not enabled. This is an autonomous path. Differential and vectoring are both enabled. Results/Analysis Results are promising. The hull is capable of withstanding the stresses expected during ocean operation. The maneuvering system also performed adequately although larger thrusters are required for faster straight line traversal. Navigation, after sufficient tuning of PID, was also to achieve a satisfactory lawnmower with desired path overlap for complete camera coverage.\nImprovements Primary goals for next iteration:\nadd interlocking design into hull segments increase vector angle increase stern thruster size switch from screw lid to locking latch lid skidplates on underside of hull custom batteries with mount navigation lights waterproof ports for powering external equipment improved PDB with power logging functionality Conclusion The craft has proved to be a highly maneuverable platform with good payload capacity. More tests will be needed but it seems promising.\n","wordCount":"1419","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/posts/auto-catamaran-mod2/posts/auto-catamaran-mod2/dome.png","datePublished":"2024-11-04T03:24:40Z","dateModified":"2024-11-04T03:24:40Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robin Wang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/auto-catamaran-mod2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Robin Wang","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Potato011/portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio.pdf title=Portfolio><span>Portfolio</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Potato011/resume/blob/main/Robin_Wang_Resume%281302024%29.pdf title=Resume><span>Resume</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Autonomous Catamaran MOD 2</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-11-04 03:24:40 +0000 UTC'>November 4, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1419 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Robin Wang&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/auto-catamaran-mod2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=http://localhost:1313/posts/auto-catamaran-mod2/dome.png alt="cat mod 2 cover"></figure><div class=post-content><h1 id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#table-of-contents>#</a></h1><ul><li><a href=#overview>Overview</a></li><li><a href=#design-considerations>Design Considerations</a><ul><li><a href=#operational>Operational</a></li><li><a href=#manufacturing>Manufacturing</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#conceptual-design--studies>Conceptual Design & Studies</a><ul><li><a href=#hull-design>Hull Design</a></li><li><a href=#acetone-weldingassembly>Acetone Welding/Assembly</a></li><li><a href=#seakeeping>Seakeeping</a></li><li><a href=#propulsion>Propulsion</a></li><li><a href=#navigation>Navigation</a></li><li><a href=#electrical-layout>Electrical Layout</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#gallery>Gallery</a></li><li><a href=#construction>Construction</a></li><li><a href=#testing>Testing</a></li><li><a href=#resultsanalysis>Results/Analysis</a></li><li><a href=#improvements>Improvements</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul><h1 id=overview>Overview<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#overview>#</a></h1><p>A production model of the ongoing catamaran USV project.

The hull is capable of withstanding the stresses expected during ocean operation. The maneuvering system also performed adequately although larger thrusters are required for faster straight line traversal. Navigation, after sufficient tuning of PID, was also to achieve a satisfactory lawnmower with desired path overlap for complete camera coverage.</p><h1 id=improvements>Improvements<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#improvements>#</a></h1><p>Primary goals for next iteration:</p><ul><li>add interlocking design into hull segments</li><li>increase vector angle</li><li>increase stern thruster size</li><li>switch from screw lid to locking latch lid</li><li>skidplates on underside of hull</li><li>custom batteries with mount</li><li>navigation lights</li><li>waterproof ports for powering external equipment</li><li>improved PDB with power logging functionality</li></ul><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h1><p>The craft has proved to be a highly maneuverable platform with good payload capacity.
