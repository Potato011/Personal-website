      <description>A prop from a certain game that I played. This cannon of unknown origins is wielded by the main protagonist. It resembles a large suitcase but unfolds into a particle cannon. This recreation features all moving components, light, as well as a functional propane plasma cannon hidden inside.

      <description>My reliable and extremely capable transport for the last few years. With over 400 lbs of carrying capacity and excellent off road handling, it&amp;rsquo;s a go-anywhere machine.
Table of Contents Overview Hardware Mods Cargo Bags/Rack Electrification Trailer Dashcams Conclusion Strange Cargo Overview I initially conceieved this idea as a compromise between my like for biking and my need to transport more than average amounts of equipment. The cargo bike is a perfect vehicle as it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper to operate than a car and allows me to bring my cargo directly into buildings instead of walking the last stretch on foot.</description>

      <description>Overview This was a project I made in high school for my AP biology class final project. The idea is a smart terrarium constructed out ot recycled parts. The frame is an old PC tower and the old ATX power supply holder was converted into an electronics housing for powering the terrarium&amp;rsquo;s various functions. At the bottom of the frame, covered in dirt, is a water reservoir which is pumped up the concrete tower and flows back down via a waterfall.</description>
