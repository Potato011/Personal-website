      <description>This is 1:1 functional replica of the spy pengling robot from the game Subnautica - Below Zero.
Overview This was my first large scale CAD assembly design. I wanted to make it as accurate as possible but also functional so I could drive it around like an RC car. Looking back, it shows hows crude my manufacturing techniques were but gave invaluable insight into how to better design robots.
CAD Model Drivetrain track pods each housing two brushed motorsThe CAD model can be divided into three primary sections which are the drivetrain, body, and head.</description>

      <title>1:12 Scale GPS/Compass Guided RC Car</title>

      <description>A 1:12 scale rc buggy fitted with GPS/compass and proximity sensing hardware allowing for autonomous waypoint navigation. This project was constructed over covid lockdown and was my first complex robotics project. The objective of this project was to learn about microcontrollers and the design procedure constructing a robot. Its construction involved arduinos, 3D printing, and GPS tech. Because it was my first non plug-n-play project, I lacked many basic skills including soldering, hence the very strange design choices.</description>

      <title>Arduino Terrarium</title>

      <description>Overview This was a project I made in high school for my AP biology class final project. The idea is a smart terrarium constructed out ot recycled parts. The frame is an old PC tower and the old ATX power supply holder was converted into an electronics housing for powering the terrarium&amp;rsquo;s various functions. At the bottom of the frame, covered in dirt, is a water reservoir which is pumped up the concrete tower and flows back down via a waterfall.</description>
