      <description>A 1:12 scale rc buggy fitted with GPS/compass and proximity sensing hardware allowing for autonomous waypoint navigation. This project was constructed over covid lockdown and was my first complex robotics project. The objective of this project was to learn about microcontrollers and the design procedure constructing a robot. Its construction involved arduinos, 3D printing, and GPS tech. Because it was my first non plug-n-play project, I lacked many basic skills including soldering, hence the very strange design choices.</description>
