      <description>A small tricopter vtol allowing for fun fixed wing FPV out of areas that lack runway space
Overview This project was my introduction into ardupilots and autonomous flight. Prior to this, all my models were simple RC planes which were either entirely manually controlled or had limited flight stabilization built into the receivers. It was a steep learning curve to start with a vtol but provided an excellent teaching experience.</description>
