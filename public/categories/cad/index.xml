      <description>A revised version of the Oceangoing Catamaran USV project.
Overview Following the construction and testing of the first Oceangoing Catamaran USV project, it was decided that a larger platform was needed to handle th rough conditions of the ocean. A major consideration was waterproofing the entire hull and streamline it for cutting through waves.

      <description>As one of the first modeling tools I learned, CAD is an integral step in my design process.
Overview Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with primarily Fusion360 and a bit of solidworks. These pieces of software are essential to modeling parts for 3D printing, laser cutting, CNCing, or just planning the completed layout. There&amp;rsquo;s not too much to talk about so I&amp;rsquo;ll just show a few of the models I&amp;rsquo;ve made.</description>

      <description>A research project in my university lab with the aim to develop highly modular, 3D printable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for research and cargo transport
Overview I originally modeled this vessel two years before its construction because I wanted to make an oceangoing RC boat that I could use to lower a camera under water to watch marine life. The project stayed as a model on my computer until the present day when I enrolled in a robotics class in uni.</description>

      <description>A computer, FPV video system, SDR radio, RC transmitter, and power system enclosed in a weatherprood case
Overview The objective of this project was to create an all in one solution for controlling drones in the field. The main systems are a laptop, FPV monitor, secondary monitor, SDR radio, RC transitter, and power system. The secondary objective was to improve thin metal welding and battery construction. After many prototypes, all systems are working properly.</description>

      <description>My reliable and extremely capable transport for the last few years. With over 400 lbs of carrying capacity and excellent off road handling, it&amp;rsquo;s a go-anywhere machine.
Table of Contents Overview Hardware Mods Cargo Bags/Rack Electrification Trailer Dashcams Conclusion Strange Cargo Overview I initially conceieved this idea as a compromise between my like for biking and my need to transport more than average amounts of equipment. The cargo bike is a perfect vehicle as it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper to operate than a car and allows me to bring my cargo directly into buildings instead of walking the last stretch on foot.</description>

      <description>This is 1:1 functional replica of the spy pengling robot from the game Subnautica - Below Zero.
Overview This was my first large scale CAD assembly design. I wanted to make it as accurate as possible but also functional so I could drive it around like an RC car. Looking back, it shows hows crude my manufacturing techniques were but gave invaluable insight into how to better design robots.
CAD Model Drivetrain track pods each housing two brushed motorsThe CAD model can be divided into three primary sections which are the drivetrain, body, and head.</description>

      <title>1:12 Scale GPS/Compass Guided RC Car</title>

      <description>A 1:12 scale rc buggy fitted with GPS/compass and proximity sensing hardware allowing for autonomous waypoint navigation. This project was constructed over covid lockdown and was my first complex robotics project. The objective of this project was to learn about microcontrollers and the design procedure constructing a robot. Its construction involved arduinos, 3D printing, and GPS tech. Because it was my first non plug-n-play project, I lacked many basic skills including soldering, hence the very strange design choices.</description>
