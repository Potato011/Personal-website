      <description>Overview A production model of the ongoing catamaran USV project. This hull emphasizes portability and waterproofness, implementing many features from previous design along with several new design elements. This craft is designed to be the most reliable and versatile craft, being easily transportable, having large payload capacity, long mission endurance.
Design Considerations To be more transportable, the length has been reduced to 5 ft and the width reduced to 4 ft allowing it to fit in elevators.</description>

      <description>A revised version of the Oceangoing Catamaran USV project.
Overview Following the construction and testing of the first Oceangoing Catamaran USV project, it was decided that a larger platform was needed to handle th rough conditions of the ocean. A major consideration was waterproofing the entire hull and streamline it for cutting through waves.

      <title>Long Endurance Fixed Wing Camera Platform</title>

      <description>A autonomous, long endurance, high altitude camera platform for gimballed fpv
Overview I planned out this aircraft to solely focus on efficiency and stable flight performance. With a 5.5Kg max takeoff weight and two 6s 10aH lipo batteries, this aircraft can stay in the air for over 3 hours. Swap one of the batteries for a downward facing DSLR camera and the aircraft becomes a capable mapping platform. Control is handled via the latest H7 processor running arduplane firmware enabling the aircraft to navigate autonomously, accept waypoint missions, and operate a three axis gimbal installed in the nose.</description>

      <description>A research project in my university lab with the aim to develop highly modular, 3D printable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for research and cargo transport
Overview I originally modeled this vessel two years before its construction because I wanted to make an oceangoing RC boat that I could use to lower a camera under water to watch marine life. The project stayed as a model on my computer until the present day when I enrolled in a robotics class in uni.</description>

      <description>A computer, FPV video system, SDR radio, RC transmitter, and power system enclosed in a weatherprood case
Overview The objective of this project was to create an all in one solution for controlling drones in the field. The main systems are a laptop, FPV monitor, secondary monitor, SDR radio, RC transitter, and power system. The secondary objective was to improve thin metal welding and battery construction. After many prototypes, all systems are working properly.</description>

      <title>High Payload Fixed Wing Testbed</title>

      <description>A high capacity cargo platform capable of lifting test equipment into the air remain on station for extended periods of time.
Overview The purpose of this airframe is to test experimental avionics and payloads. The airframe has high internal volume to fit bulky cargo as well as hardpoints on both wings for external loads. While the original intention was for this plane to fly, I&amp;rsquo;ve deemed the risk too high and as such, this airframe is to remain on the ground for testing.</description>

      <description>A small tricopter vtol allowing for fun fixed wing FPV out of areas that lack runway space
Overview This project was my introduction into ardupilots and autonomous flight. Prior to this, all my models were simple RC planes which were either entirely manually controlled or had limited flight stabilization built into the receivers. It was a steep learning curve to start with a vtol but provided an excellent teaching experience.</description>

      <title>1:12 Scale GPS/Compass Guided RC Car</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/auto-car/</link>

      <description>A 1:12 scale rc buggy fitted with GPS/compass and proximity sensing hardware allowing for autonomous waypoint navigation. This project was constructed over covid lockdown and was my first complex robotics project. The objective of this project was to learn about microcontrollers and the design procedure constructing a robot. Its construction involved arduinos, 3D printing, and GPS tech. Because it was my first non plug-n-play project, I lacked many basic skills including soldering, hence the very strange design choices.</description>
